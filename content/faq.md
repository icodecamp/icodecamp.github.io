## What are the dates for Code Camp?

Camp dates are May 25 to August 10, 2017. You should choose one date for each lesson:

* Lesson one: May 25 and/or June 1
* Lesson two: June 8 and/or June 15
* Lesson three: June 22 and/or June 29
* Lesson four: July 6 and/or July 13
* Lesson five: July 20 and/or July 27
* Lesson six: August 3 and/or August 10

## Why are there two classes for each lesson?

Some of the feedback we got after our pilot Code Camp in 2016 was that it is difficult for students to complete the course in the summer because of travel plans and jamati activities. Providing two dates for each lesson allows students to plan their attendance at Camp around any travel plans they may already have. This also allows students to attend a lesson twice to review concepts or spend extra time with instructors for a particularly difficult lesson. 

## Where are classes held?

Each class will be held in Chicago Ismaili Jamatkhana social hall. 

## How are classes structured?

Each class will cover an important programming or Python concept. You will be required to complete homework assignments and "push" code to Github -- this means your code will be sent to a public folder where your instructors for review.

## Who are the instructors?

Your instructors this year are Khurram Ghulamani, Danish Noorani and Taufiq Dhanani.
