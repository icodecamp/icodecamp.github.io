## What is programming?

Programming is a way to tell a computer what to do with a series of commands. It is increasingly being used in all kinds of fields -- from law to journalism to filmmaking. Check out [this two-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&v=FCMxA3m_Imc) on what programming is, or [this interesting article](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) to get more background.
