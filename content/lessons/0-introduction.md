# Welcome to iCodeCamp
There are __three__ steps you must complete before your first before class. If you run into trouble, no worries we'll work with you during class. Good Luck!

1. __Install Sublime Text__

    > [__download link for Mac__](https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.2.dmg)

    > [__download link for Windows__](https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.2a%20x64%20Setup.exe)

    > [__alternative download link for windows x86__](https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.2a%20Setup.exe)

2. __Create Github Account__
  
    > [__Create a username and password__](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)

    > definitely select the "Free Plan" on step 2 of the signup process 

3. __Installing Git__
    
    > __mac users__ open the application called "terminal" and type `git --version` in the black box that appears. 

    > If you get a response similar to `git version #.##.# (Apple Git-78)`, then you're good. Otherwise, download git from [__here__](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
    
    
    > __windows users__ follow the instructions for windows [__here__](https://www.edureka.co/blog/install-git/)
