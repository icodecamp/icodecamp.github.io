# What are Data Structures?
>Definition of data structure. Types of data structures in python 

> __strings__ _immutable_ ordered sequences of characters 

> `stringy = "hello, world!"`


> __lists__ _mutable_ ordered sequences of any type of object 

> `listy = [1.0, 2, 3, "a", "bee", "see", true]`


> __tuples__ _immutable_ ordered sequences of any type of object 

> `tupley = (1.0, 2, 3, "a", "bee", "see", true)`

> __dictionaries__ key value storage 

> `dicty = { "a" : "apple", "b" : "banana", "g" : "giordanos is the best", "really?" : true }`

Activity 
Use indexes (especially zero index) 
Use keys to update your score 


# What are Loops?
>Definition 
##### For Loop
##### While Loop
##### Range 
##### Break
##### continue
Activity:

# Activity 
Activity 
While (true): 
User types in a string, then you add the string to an array, and then you speak outloud all strings in array as a sentence 
If user types in “exit” quit program 
Function that takes in a string and actually reads it out loud 
Introduce assignment and clear up confusion 
About pixels (RBG) 
Double for loops 

# Project 
Mini-project to push to Github
Photo manipulation
Select an image, the program will loop through all pixels and edit the blue value by 10% or something and make the image more blue
Optional part 2: rotate the image or something 
TODO:
For pixels in x 
For pixels in y 
pixel(x,y)[2] = pixel(x,y)[2] * 1.5
